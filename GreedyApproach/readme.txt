-> The Greedy approach states that the problem can be solved by multiple levels of computations and 
    selecting the best solution at each level

-> It means selecting local optimum at each level and hopes this gives the global optimum 

-> Steps in greedy 
   1.Optimization(max or min) 
   2.Sort the information
   3.No fixed algorithm or approach
   4.we wont realize the use of greedy
